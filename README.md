## 🕵️ About Me
I’m a Mechanical Engineer specializing in Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs), currently studying at the Faculty of Computers and Data Science, Alexandria University.

Somewhere between designing pressure-resistant hardware and writing Object-Oriented code, I realized something important: hardware is awesome, but the data it generates is where the real magic happens. Now, I am bringing my systems-thinking mindset from the physical world into the digital world of Data Engineering.

I know my way around Java, Python, and SQL, and I'm actively expanding my toolkit to architect reliable, scalable data systems. If I can engineer a machine to survive the crushing pressure of the ocean, I can definitely handle complex data transformations!

<h3>🌊 Why hire an ROV Engineer for Data?</h3> 
<p>
<b>Fault Tolerance: </b>I am used to building systems where a failure means losing expensive hardware at the bottom of the sea. I treat data infrastructure with the same level of care.

<b>First-Principles Thinking: </b>I don't just memorize syntax; my background in physics and mechanics means I naturally break complex software problems down to their most basic, solvable parts.

<b>Telemetry & Sensors: </b>I understand the physical reality of how data is generated in the real world before it ever hits a database.

⭐️ <b>Currently open to opportunities in Data Engineering, Backend Development, and System Architecture.</b>
